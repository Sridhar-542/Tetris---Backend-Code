As a part of master thesis I developed an extend version for the tetris game with a study platform to measure the performance and experience of the players while playing Tetris under the influence of music.

# Code Editor

You can open the code on any code edtors. Also, this supports windows, Mac and Linux operating systems.

## Backend (Development Server)

Run `npm install` to install the required npm packages

Run `npm start` for a dev server.

By executing these two commands, you will be successfully connected to the database.

Once you are done with establishing the DB connection, head over to "Tetris---Frontend-Code" folder and open README.md file and read instructions to initiate ng server from the front end.

That's it...you are all done! Happy Gaming!
